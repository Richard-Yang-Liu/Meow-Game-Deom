# Meow Games Collection

Welcome to the **Meow Games Collection** â€“ a growing series of fun and accessible web-based mini-games, built for learning, creativity, and sharing!  
This project is a personal journey of game development, where I continuously design, build, and refine casual games such as **Tetris**, **Meow Jump**, and more.
